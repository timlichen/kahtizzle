# New Ideas

The following are ideas for add-ons, modifications, etc.
This file is distinct from README.md as it is meant to discuss potential aspects of the game that are still being debated.

## New Cards

We can utilize some of the Devo cards used in the Catan: Cities and Knights Expansion (Mobile version).

* Medicine
	* The cost of upgrading a Settlement to a City is reduced to 1 wheat and 2 ore.

* Road Movement/Removal
	* You can remove a rival's road that has a loose end (isn't connected on both ends) -OR- move one of your loose-end roads to another legitimate location.

* Switch roll number on resource hex
	* Take the roll number on a hex and switch it with another. You should not be able to switch a low roll number with a high one. For example, switching an 11 with a 5 should be OK, but not an 11 with a 6 or 8.

* Spy
	* You may steal a rival's Devo card. The original card allows you to look at their cards before stealing, but this may be OP.

* Irrigation
	* Collect 2 wheat for every wheat hex you border.

* Mining
	* Collect 2 ore for every ore hex you border.

* Alchemist
	* Instead of rolling, you announce a "roll" number.

* Merchant Fleet
	* Trade any resource(s?) at a 2:1 ratio with the bank.

There are more "Progress" cards that come with Cities and Knights, but these are arguably the best.

## Metropolises

Another feature of Cities and Knights is the Metropolis upgrade for Cities. An idea is we can have these simply be uber cities that give one of each resource around that Metropolis if one of its hexes gets rolled. Let's say we roll an 8 on Sheep next to a Metropolis; you get 2 Sheep, but also 1 of each resource also bordering the Metropolis, so like 1 ore and 1 wheat as well.

## City Walls

Another feature of Cities and Knights - for 2 Brick you can build walls around a City, which raises your 7-roll cap by another 2 cards. So if you have 1 walled City, you can safely have 9 cards in hand when a 7 gets rolled (without having to forfeit any cards).

## Role Cards

In the Star Trek version of Catan, every player has a role card that gives him/her a unique ability that can be used twice before a new role is taken. For example, one role allows you to move the robber to the desert at any time during your turn.

## Things to think about

* Number of players
	* We should be careful about space usage, how long turns are and how long it takes to rotate, etc.

* Joining late
	* If players can join late, they suffer a disadvantage - is that a problem?
