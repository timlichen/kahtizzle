* Board B

```

```

* Board C

```

```

On each board, the starting positions for 2 players are indicated in
predetermined player colours. These 2 players share the board and the
corresponding game components.

In each game round one of the 2 players at this board is the active player.

All players belong to one of two groups so it is always clear whose turn it is
* Group "Sun"
* Group "Moon"

Each side of the board is marked with a sun on one side and a moon on the other.

In addition the island is divided by a "Dividing line" for strating territories
* This can be seen here
